# CrushConnect - Quick Start Guide

## Step 1: Get Your Bot Token

1. Open Telegram and message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Send `/newbot`
3. Choose a name: `CrushConnect`
4. Choose a username: `CrushConnectBot` (or any available name ending in 'bot')
5. Copy the bot token (looks like: `1234567890:ABCdefGhIJKlmNoPQRsTUVwxyZ`)

## Step 2: Create Your Channel

1. Create a new Telegram channel
2. Make it public with username: `AAUCrushConnect`
3. Add your bot as admin with posting permissions

## Step 3: Get Your User ID

1. Message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)
2. It will reply with your user ID (a number like `123456789`)

## Step 4: Configure Environment

Edit `.env` file and update:

```env
BOT_TOKEN=paste_your_bot_token_here
CHANNEL_ID=@AAUCrushConnect
ADMIN_GROUP_ID=paste_your_user_id_here
```

## Step 5: Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
